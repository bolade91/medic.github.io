</section>
<section id="settings">
	<h3>General Settings</h3><hr class="notop">
<p>
	This is an important section where all the app&#39;s settings can be managed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Absolute path of Booking Calendar installation</strong></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s a very important setting and must be set to make the whole app working. If you do not set, the app won&#39;t work at all.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Timezone</strong></p>
<p>
	This setting is needed to make sure that no one can reserve a time slot in the past.<br>
	i.e. My timezone is GMT +1 but I set it to GMT 0, if now it&#39;s 10.00, people will be able to reserve the 9.30 time slot as for GMT 0 timezone it&#39;s 9.00, and that is wrong.<br>
	Using the set timezone properly, the app won&#39;t show past time slots so they cannot be reserved.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Calendar date format</strong></p>
<p>
	Choose if you prefer to use UK (dd/mm/yyyy and the weeks starting on Monday) or US (mm/dd/yyyy and the weeks starting on Sunday) date format.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Calendar time format</strong></p>
<p>
	Choose if you prefer to use 12-hour time format (with am/pm) or 24-hour time format.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Admin Email</strong></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s useful to receive reservation emails. If someone reserve a time slot, you&#39;ll receive an e-mail to this address.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Email &quot;from&quot;</strong></p>
<p>
	This email address is the one which will send all emails from system to customers. You can also choose a custom name to be shown as sender. Leaving this field empty could make system emails to be sent directly to user&#39;s spam folder. You can also put a fake address, but it is recommendable not leaving it empty.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Reservation: confirmation mode</strong></p>
<p>
	Here you can choose how you want the reservation will be confirmed.<br>
	If you choose &quot;Automatically&quot;, reservation will be automatically confirmed when a user request for it.<br>
	If you choose &quot;By a verification email&quot;, user will have to confirm his/her reservation by clicking on a link sent from app to their email address. The link will expire a minute before the first reserved time slot starts or if the admin confirms/unconfirms the reservation manually.<br>
	If you choose &quot;Admin confirm&quot;, you must manually confirm all the reservations from the admin panel.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Reservation: cancellation</strong></p>
<p>
	Enabling this feature allows your customers to cancel their reservations by clicking in a link that they will find in the confirmation email (see <a href="#manage_mail">Manage mail</a> section for further information). The link will expire a minute before the first reserved time slot starts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Google Recaptcha</strong></p>
<p>
	This setting is just up to you. If you&#39;re afraid of spam, go to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">http://www.google.com/recaptcha</a>, obtain your keys and paste them in the fields. A captcha image will appear in reservation form, so you are sure that it&#39;s a human being who&#39;s reserving a time slot.</p>

<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Add terms and condition check</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	You can choose to add a checkbox for privacy policy and/or terms of service for the booking form. Adding this option, the user must check it before he is able to book.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	When activating it you can choose the label to show beside the checkbox and an optional link to point the user to your privacy policy/terms of service page.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Slot selection</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Choose here how many slots are reservable by one customer at once.</div>

<p>
	<strong>Unlimited reservations</strong></p>
<p>
	Choose if every slot can have unlimited reservations. If set to unlimited, calendar slots amount will never decrease. If set to "use the number set in slot insertion", every slot will have the number of reservations you'll set in slot creation.<br /> If you select the second option you'll be able to choose to show the available seats number instead of the slots number. I.e. If you have 10 slots with 2 seats each, if you decide to show the available seats, you'll see "Available: 20" in the corresponding day cell, otherwise you'll see "Available: 10" as the time slots are 10.</p>
<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Show booked slots</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	You can choose to show the already booked slots by enabling this option. The booked slots will not disappear from calendar, but they will be shown in red color.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Available time slots preview</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	This is just a &quot;graphic&quot; setting. If you want to show to customers a preview of available time slots when they are navigating into calendar, check &quot;enabled&quot;.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Show category selection</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can set if you want to show or not the category selection drop down menu at the right top of the page.</div>
<div class="label_title">

<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Show calendar selection</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can set if you want to show or not the calendar selection drop down at the right top of the page.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Show the first not empty month by default</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can set if you want to show the first month which has time slots. If you set it to "YES" and for example you don't have any time slots till two months later, on November, the first month to be shown won't be the current November, the first month which has time slots set.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>

 <div class="label_title">
	<strong>Calendar months view</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can choose if you want to show a number of limited past and future months. When a user tries to go beyond the range you set, he will be redirected to the current month. Leave "0" if you want to show unlimited months.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
 <div class="label_title">
	<strong>Choose when users are able to book a slot</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can choose if you want to limit the user booking. Insert the number of days before the slot date the user can book. E.g. you set "2": the user won't be able to book for today and neither for tomorrow, but he will be able to book from the day after tomorrow (2 days from now). Leave "0" if you want to let him booking even at the last minute.<br>You can then choose a limit for the maximum number of days (starting from current), for which the user is able to book. E.g. you set "10" and today is the 1st of April: the user will be able to book only till the 10th of April even if on the next days there are available slots.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	<strong>Display prices in booking page</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can choose if you want to show slots prices in the booking form page. Remember to set the right currency too if you enabled it.</div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
 <div class="label_title">
	<strong>Enable Paypal payment</strong></div>
<div class="label_title">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div class="label_title">
	Here you can set if you want your users to pay the booking fee. By setting "YES", you'll have some fields to fill in. </div>
<div class="label_title">
	First of all, the email address associated with your Paypal account. Then you have to choose your country for the language and other local settings of the Paypal landing page. All these 2 fields are mandatory, if you leave one of them empty, Paypal payment will not be activated.
	</div>
<div class="label_title">
	 Then you'll be asked to choose whether the reservations must be automatically confirmed after Paypal payment or not. If you set it to "YES", and you have previously set the option "Reservation: confirmation mode" to "By a verification e-mail" or "Admin confirm", this rule will override them and the automatic confirmation will be applied after the payment.<br>
The last option to set is whether or not reservations must be stored in the database before the payment. In the previous versions of the script (<= 3.3), the reservation was always stored in the database before the payment with "unconfirmed" status and only after the payment it was automatically confirmed. With this new option instead, you can store the reservation only after the Paypal payment. Please note that if Paypal doesn't return the payment result, whether the connection is lost, or due to a malfunction, a breakdown, the reservation will be lost and the slot will still be available.<br>
By activating Paypal, when you create new slots, you'll be asked for a price for the new slots you are creating, if you already have some slots and you activate Paypal later, you'll have to manually change the price for every slot or recreate them to activate the payment. Slots which have "0" as price, will not be charged to the user.<br>
If you have mixed slots, with fee and free, if a user books free ones, the application will behave as usual (as Paypal was set to "NO"). This option will step in only if the user books a priced slot.

<section id="texts_management">
	<h3>Texts Management</h3><hr class="notop">
    <p>
    In this section you can manage all the texts of the app in both admin panel and public section.
    </p>
    <p>
    The texts are divided into sections according to the admin panel menu, to make the translation easier.
    </p>
    <p>
    To change a text you just have to modify the text you find in the field near the text shortcode, then click on "Save" and it's done.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are upgrading from a previous version of the Booking Calendar you'll see a yellow box at the top of the page saying that you can recover the modifications made to "lang.php" files in the previous version. Just upload the files and check the new texts.<br />
    N.B. Note that not all the texts will be correctly updated. Check them in the new "Text management" section.<br />
	N.B. If you haven't changed any of the "lang.php" files, DON'T do this procedure.    
    </p>
</section>
<section id="categories">
	<h3>Manage Categories</h3><hr class="notop">
    <p>
	This section allow you to view, add, publish, unpublish and delete all your categories.</p>
<p>
	As you can see you can add more than one category.</p>
<p>For each category you'll also have at your disposal a direct link to the category with all its calendars.</p>
<p>
  You must create at least a category item to make the app working.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Adding Categories</strong></p>
<p>
	It&#39; s easy to add a category, just type the name of your category and click &quot;Add&quot;. You&#39;ll see your category appearing in the list below. A new category is never published when created, because it&#39;s empty, it has no calendars yet, so it would be useless to show it on the app.</p>
<p>
	If you add more than one category, you&#39;ll see the button &quot;set as default&quot; appearing below the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon as there must be a default category if you have more than one. The default category will be the first appearing when the app is loaded.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Modify a category name</strong></p>
<p>
	To modify a category name, just click on &quot;Modify name&quot; and type the new name, then click on &quot;Save&quot;.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Publish/Unpublish categories</strong></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s easy to publish or unpublish a category. If you want to change just one category status, you can click on the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon and that&#39;s it. </p>
<p>
	If you need to change more than one category status, you can select the categories you want to publish or unpublish and then click on &quot;Publish&quot; or &quot;Unpublish&quot; on the action bar at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
	Publishing or unpublishing a category is useful if you need to do some modifications on category calendars and you don&#39;t want people to see that you&#39;re working on it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Delete categories</strong></p>
<p>
	You can also delete one category or more.</p>
<p>
	To delete only one category, just click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the corresponding category row. To delete more than one category, select the categories you want to delete and then click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the action bar at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
	Once you&#39;ve deleted a category, all related information will be deleted (such as calendars, time slots and reservations). Be careful using this function, if someone has already reserved a time slot of a calendar in the category you want to delete, you should warn that person that the time slot is no longer available.</p>
</section>
<section id="calendars">
	<h3>Manage Calendars</h3><hr class="notop">
<p>
	This section allow you to view, add, publish, unpublish and delete all your calendars.</p>
<p>
	As you can see you can add more than one calendar. i.e. You have a tennis court and a squash court to reserve, you can use two different calendars.<br /> For each calendar you'll also have at your disposal a direct link to each calendar.</p>
<p>
	You must create at least a calendar item to make the app working.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Adding calendars</strong></p>
<p>
	It&#39; s easy to add a calendar, just click on &quot;Add&quot; and you'll see a simple form to fill in. Just select the category which the calendar must belong to (you have to insert at least a category to create a calendar), write the name of the calendar, optionally you can also add an email address where the reservations will be received instead of the default one set in &quot;Settings&quot; section, and click on &quot;Save&quot;. You&#39;ll be redirected to the calendar list where you can see your brand new calendar. A new calendar is never published when created, because it&#39;s empty, it has no time slots yet, so it would be useless to show it on the app.</p>
<p>
	If you add more than one calendar, you&#39;ll see the button &quot;set as default&quot; appearing below the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon as there must be a default calendar if you have more than one. The default calendar will be the first appearing when its category is loaded.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Modify a calendar </strong></p>
<p>
	Modifying calendars is easy as creating them. Just click on &quot;Modify&quot; on the corresponding calendar row and you'll see again the form you used to insert the calendar. Make the modifications and then click on &quot;Save&quot; and it's done!</p>

	<strong>Publish/Unpublish calendars</strong></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s easy to publish or unpublish a calendar. If you want to change just one calendar status, you can click on the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon and that&#39;s it. </p>
<p>
	If you need to change more than one calendar status, you can select the calendars you want to publish or unpublish and then click on &quot;Publish&quot; or &quot;Unpublish&quot; on the action bar at the top.</p>
<p>
	Publishing or unpublishing a calendar, is useful if you need to do some modifications on calendar time slots and you don&#39;t want people to see that you&#39;re working on it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Delete calendars</strong></p>
<p>
	You can also delete one calendar or more.</p>
<p>
	To delete only one calendar, just click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the corrisponding calendar row. To delete more than one calendar, select the calendars you want to delete and then click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the action bar at the top.</p>
<p>
	Once you&#39;ve deleted a calendar, all related information will be deleted (such as time slots and reservations). Be careful using this function, if someone has already reserved a time slot of a calendar you want to delete, you must warn that person that the time slot is no longer available.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Duplicate calendars</strong></p>
<p>
	You can also duplicate existing calendars. Avoid losing time to insert a new calendar and its slots by duplicating an already existing one (with all slots and holidays). You will always be able to edit the duplicated calendar.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Managing calendars</strong></p>
<p>
	When you click on &quot;Manage&quot; on a calendar row, you&#39;ll be redirected to the calendar manage section.</p>
<p>
	In this section you&#39;ll find a submenu with two voices: &quot;Manage time slots&quot; and &quot;Closing days&quot;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Manage time slots</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	This section is the default one opened when you enter in calendar managing section.<br>
	You can create time slots by clicking on &quot;Create Time Slots&quot;. A form will open and you&#39;ll be able to insert all the information about your time slots.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>Create time slots</strong><br>
	First you&#39;re asked to specify the date or the period for which you want to create time slots.<br>
	If you choose a period, you&#39;ll be able to select for which weekdays you want to create time slots. i.e. from Monday to Friday.<br>
	If you choose just a single date, time slots will be created just for that day.<br>
	Then you&#39;re asked to specify each slot duration.<br>
	If you choose &quot;in minutes&quot;, you&#39;ll have to specifiy how many minutes each time slot lasts. Minimum time slot duration is 15 minutes. A time slot will be created after another, every &quot;tot&quot; minutes you specified. You can also set a &quot;pause&quot; value between every time slot. (i.e.slots every 30 minutes, 5 minutes pause, each time slot will be created every 35 minutes.)<br>
	Then you have to specify when these slots must be created. You can choose a time from and a time to (or more than one) regarding every day. (i.e. creating time slots from 9.00 to 13.00 and from 14.00 to 18.00 every 30 minutes.)<br>
	If you choose &quot;from, to&quot;, you will be able to insert customized time slots, as many as you want. Insert time from and time to for first slot and then click on &quot;plus&quot; button to add other available intervals.<br>
    You can also insert a description text and a price for the slots you are creating.<br>
    If you've chosen to set a limited number of possible reservations per slot, you'll find a field to insert this data. Plus, you'll find also a field where you can set the maximum number of seats bookable by a single customer.<br>
	Then click on &quot;Save&quot; and wait a while, time slots will be created and you&#39;ll be able to see them on your calendar, to modify, delete and search for them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>N.B. </strong>Be careful inserting new time slots, if you have previously created time slots in a certain time intervals the system will not allow you to create time slots in the same time intervals. (The system does not create a time slot duplicate)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Once you&#39;ve created your first time slots, you&#39;ll see two more buttons appearing: &quot;Search time slots&quot; and &quot;Modify time slots&quot;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>Search time slots</strong><br>
	You can search time slots in the calendars using this form.<br>
	First of all, choose if you want to search time slots for a single day or a period of time.<br>
	If you choose to search for a single day, you must specify the day and, optionally, a time from and a time to between which the search will be done. You can also choose just &quot;time from&quot; to see all time slots from a certain time.<br>
	If you choose to search ina period of time, you must specify date from and date to. Then you can specify a weekday and a time from and a time to. Just period dates are mandatory.<br>
	Clicking on &quot;Search&quot; you&#39;ll find all time slots found for the specified parameters.<br>
	From that list, you&#39;ll be able to modify a single time slot, or to delete one or more time slots at once.<br>
	Clicking on &quot;Modify&quot; on a time slot row, you can change time slot&#39;s date, time from, time to, special text, price and seats, if set. Before changing, be sure that there are no other slots for the day and the same time you want to set, otherwise you won&#39;t be able to modify it.<br>
	Clicking on &quot;Delete&quot; on a time slot row, that time slot will be deleted. You&#39;ll be warned if there is a reservation for that slot, so you&#39;ll be able to warn the person who made it.<br>
	You can also delete several time slots at once by selecting them and clicking on &quot;Delete&quot; on the action bar above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>Modify time slots</strong><br>
	Using this feature, you can modify/delete several time slots.<br>
	First select the action you want to perform.<br>
	If you choose &quot;modify&quot; you&#39;ll be asked to select the time slots you want to modify. i.e. all 9.00 time slots. Then you can select a weekday and the period (date from and date to). Last but not least, you have to specify new time from and time to for the time slots to modify. As always, be careful to choose a "free" time (not taken up by other time slots).<br>
	If you choose &quot;delete&quot; you&#39;ll be asked to select the time slots you want to delete. i.e. all 9.00 time slots. Then you can select a weekday and the period (date from and date to) or if you want to choose just a single day leave the &quot;date to&quot; field empty.<br>
	Then, clicking on &quot;Ok&quot;, the chosen action will be performed. Always remember that deleting time slots means delete all the related items, such as reservations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Closing days</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Using this feature you can set closing days in your calendars. These days will not be available for booking. For example, if your company closes for a week you can select these days as closing days. So, when you create new time slots, you won&#39;t have to be careful not to insert time slots for those days, system will do it for you automatically!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>Create closing days</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Clicking on &quot;Create closing days&quot; you&#39;re asked to specify if you want to create a single day or a period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	If you choose &quot;A single day&quot;, you&#39;ll have to specify the date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	If you choose &quot;Period of time&quot;, you&#39;ll have to specify date from and date to. Date from and date to are included in creating closing days.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Then click &quot;Ok&quot; and it&#39;s done.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>N.B.</strong> If you choose days in which there are time slots, or reservations, they will be deleted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Every time you create a closing day, you&#39;ll find it in the list below the insertion box. If you want to delete the closing days select them and click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the action bar above (one by one or several at once).</p>
